# TravelWeather-Project2
This was a large project that was done for the Rutgers Data Science Boot Camp along with three other teammates.  It is a practical application that gives clothing suggestions based on a location in the US.  This application uses data that details weather forecasts throughout the US as well as a scraping tool that scrapes clothing data from the Bloomingdales website to be displayed on the application.

My role in this project was originally to include graph statistics on the selected location's weather data.  However, this was eventually cut and my role shifted to assisting with building the map used in the application and styling the website.

This project lasted for roughly 2 weeks and comprised of most of our class time.

Languages that were used were Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, and MongoDB.

Tools used were Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, CLI, MySQL Workbench, and MongoDB Compass.
